Detect duplicate or highly similar slash commands across the commands/public and commands/private directories.

Your task:
1. Read through all slash command files
2. Analyze command content for:
   - Exact duplicates (same content, different locations)
   - Near-duplicates (very similar purpose/content)
   - Commands that could be consolidated
   - Commands with overlapping functionality
3. Compare command purposes and identify redundancy

Present your findings with:
- Groups of duplicate/similar commands
- File paths for each command in the group
- Similarity assessment (exact duplicate, near duplicate, overlapping)
- Recommendations for consolidation or removal
- Suggested action for each duplicate set

After presenting the analysis, ask if I want you to:
- Remove duplicates automatically
- Consolidate similar commands
- Just flag them for manual review
