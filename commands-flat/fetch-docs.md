This repository contains a docs folder - or this is it. 

It may contain a scratchpad file containing the urls to reference documentation that will be useful for this project. 

Your task is to take those URLs, fetch the content, and save in this folder as markdown files.

Firstly, try to invoke your own fetch function for this task. 

If that does not work or yield a satsifactory result, use Firecrawl MCP.
