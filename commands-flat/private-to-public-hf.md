This repository contains a proof of concept/demo.

It was originally a private app - therefore, it relies upon references to API keys as environment variables.

This repository will redeploy the app as a public POC.

Therefore, the task is to implement the following changes:

- Remove the references to environment variables and instead implement a BYOK mechanism 
- User keys should be held in the local browser memory only  
- UI should now include an API key paste area and a short instruction on providing the key
