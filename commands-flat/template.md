The user wishes to make this clear so visitors understand they can use this as a starting point.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add a Template badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a green or teal color for the template badge
- Consider adding a "Use this template" button note if this is a GitHub template repository
