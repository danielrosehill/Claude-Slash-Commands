Create reference documentation for the codebase.

Your task:
1. Analyze the code to identify key components, functions, classes, and APIs
2. Generate reference documentation covering:
   - Main modules/components and their purposes
   - Key functions/methods with parameters and return values
   - Important classes with their properties and methods
   - API endpoints (if applicable)
   - Configuration options
   - Workflows and processes

Format as clear, navigable documentation. Include code examples where helpful.

Save in a `docs/` or `reference/` folder as appropriate. Use markdown format for easy maintenance and readability.
