This repository is an indexing repository. 

I create these to gather together resources I create about a common topic.

I also have a master index which I use as a "top level" map of the repos I create on Github.

That's here:

https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index

Please:

Add a link to the master index, using Shields.io, to the top of the readme. If there is an existing badges section, add that into it. if not, create one alongside an index repo badge.

The purpose of these links is to make it easier to jump between the various indexing related repos I have on Github.
