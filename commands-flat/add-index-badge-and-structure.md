This repository is an index/collection of related repositories organized around a common theme.

The user wishes to make this clear so visitors understand this is a curated list rather than a single project.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add an Index badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a color like blue or teal for the index badge

Add this section near the top of the README (after any intro/description):

## Repository Index

This repository serves as an index of related repositories organized around a common theme.

### About this index

[Placeholder for index description - ask the user what theme/topic this index covers]

### Repositories in this collection

[Placeholder for repository list - this will be populated with links to the related repos]

---

**Note:** This is a focused index covering a specific topic area. For a higher-level collection of all repository indexes and other projects, see the [GitHub Master Index](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index).

///

Ask the user:
1. What is the common theme or topic that unifies these repositories?
2. How many repositories are currently in this index?
3. Should the repositories be organized in categories/sections or just listed?
4. Are there specific criteria for what gets included in this index?
5. Is this index actively maintained/updated?

Integrate these details to help visitors understand the scope and organization of the index.
