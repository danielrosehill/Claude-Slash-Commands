This repository contains a number of documentation and reference files at its base.

I would like you to rationalise these files as follows:

- Instructions for you (Claude) are gathered in CLAUDE.md 
- I use context .md (or similar ) to jot down ideas for the project 
- Reference docs (for me) can be gathered in their own folder but only create them when there's something very compelling to document  

Any other files at this level should be integrated into the existing ones
