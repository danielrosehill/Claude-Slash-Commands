Set up continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for this project.

Your task:
1. Understand deployment requirements:
   - Target environment (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.)
   - Build process and artifacts
   - Environment variables and secrets
   - Testing requirements

2. Choose and configure CI/CD platform:
   - **GitHub Actions** (recommended for GitHub repos)
   - **GitLab CI**
   - **CircleCI**
   - **Jenkins**

3. Create workflow configuration:
   - Set up build pipeline
   - Configure testing stage
   - Set up deployment stage
   - Configure triggers (push, PR, tags)

4. Example GitHub Actions workflow:
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Setup
         - name: Build
         - name: Test
         - name: Deploy
   ```

5. Configure deployment:
   - Set up deployment secrets
   - Configure deployment environments
   - Set up environment-specific variables
   - Add deployment status checks

6. Document the pipeline:
   - Workflow stages explained
   - How to trigger deployments
   - How to monitor pipeline status
   - Rollback procedures

Establish scalable continuous deployment for the development repository.
