This repository contains a file called CLAUDE.md which provides structured instructions and context for Claude Code.

I would like to extract information from CLAUDE.md and incorporate it into context.md (or CONTEXT.md) as supplementary contextual information. This is useful when CLAUDE.md contains details that should be preserved in the more detailed, narrative context file.

Execute two tasks in sequence:

1: Extract relevant information: Review CLAUDE.md and identify information that would be valuable to preserve in the context file. This might include project requirements, implementation details, vision statements, or other contextual information that provides deeper understanding of the project.

2: Update context.md: Add the extracted information to context.md (or CONTEXT.md, whichever exists), integrating it naturally with existing content. Maintain the narrative, conversational style of the context file while preserving the important details from CLAUDE.md. Add clear section headers if introducing new topics.
