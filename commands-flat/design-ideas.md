Brainstorm innovative UI, UX, and CSS design ideas for the project.

Your task:
1. Ask user to describe their desired direction:
   - Design goals (modern, minimal, playful, professional)
   - Target audience
   - Inspiration sources (websites, apps, design systems)
   - Constraints (brand guidelines, accessibility requirements)

2. Generate design suggestions across areas:

   **Layout & Structure:**
   - Grid systems (CSS Grid, Flexbox patterns)
   - Page layouts (hero sections, card layouts, asymmetric designs)
   - Navigation patterns (sticky nav, mega menu, sidebar)
   - Responsive strategies

   **Visual Design:**
   - Color schemes (monochromatic, complementary, triadic)
   - Typography combinations
   - Spacing systems
   - Visual hierarchy approaches

   **Interactive Elements:**
   - Button styles and hover effects
   - Form design patterns
   - Loading states and animations
   - Micro-interactions
   - Transition effects

   **Modern CSS Techniques:**
   - CSS custom properties for theming
   - Backdrop filters and glassmorphism
   - CSS animations and keyframes
   - Scroll-driven animations
   - Container queries

3. Present ideas with visual descriptions:
   ```markdown
   ## Design Concept 1: Glassmorphism Dashboard

   **Visual Style:**
   - Frosted glass effect cards
   - Soft shadows and blurs
   - Vibrant gradient backgrounds
   - Rounded corners throughout

   **CSS Approach:**
   - backdrop-filter: blur(10px)
   - Semi-transparent backgrounds
   - Box shadows for depth

   ## Design Concept 2: Brutalist Minimalism

   **Visual Style:**
   - Bold, high-contrast typography
   - Grid-based rigid layouts
   - Monochrome color palette
   - No animations, direct interactions
   ```

4. Include code snippets for key techniques

5. Suggest design system resources:
   - Tailwind UI
   - Material Design
   - Ant Design
   - Chakra UI
   - Custom design tokens

Allow users to explore creative design directions before implementation.
