Go through the website and see any place in which icons have been implemented which were custom designed but which could have been implemented more efficiently through using an existing icon library. Pay particular attention to icons for common uses such as social media icons which exist in many libraries, as well as emojis which may have been used in place of icons. This approach should not be followed. If the user uses an existing icon library that you can identify, then replace the custom coded icons with the most appropriate matches. If the user hasn't yet implemented an icon library, provide some suggestions to the user, focusing on those libraries which will best match the aesthetic which they are following in their designs.
