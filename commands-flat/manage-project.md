Set up and maintain a structured project repository with task management.

Your task:
1. Create project structure:
   ```
   project/
   ├── docs/
   │   ├── PROJECT_SCOPE.md
   │   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
   │   └── API.md
   ├── src/
   ├── tests/
   ├── TODO.md
   ├── CHANGELOG.md
   └── README.md
   ```

2. Set up task management system:

   **Option 1: Simple TODO.md**
   ```markdown
   # Project Tasks

   ## In Progress
   - [ ] Task currently being worked on

   ## To Do
   - [ ] High priority task
   - [ ] Medium priority task

   ## Done
   - [x] Completed task 1
   - [x] Completed task 2

   ## Blocked
   - [ ] Task blocked by [reason]
   ```

   **Option 2: GitHub Issues Integration**
   - Create issue templates
   - Set up labels (bug, feature, docs, etc.)
   - Create milestones
   - Link to project board

3. Maintain project documentation:
   - Update README as project evolves
   - Keep CHANGELOG current
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Track dependencies

4. System updates:
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security patch monitoring
   - Version bumps
   - Breaking change tracking

5. Provide project overview dashboard:
   - Current status
   - Active tasks

   - Next milestones

Help maintain organized, well-documented project structure with clear task tracking.
