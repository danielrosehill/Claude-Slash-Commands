Please pause development and generate a progress summary document which you should store in the from AI folder if it exists in this repository. In this document, you should provide a detailed note of the development that we undertook in this chat/conversation. Summarize where we began, the changes that we implemented to the code base, and any blockers that remain and have prevented us from making further progress. If the user instructs for any additional notes to be appended to the document, include them. They document that you generate should be a thorough document which provides sufficient context for you or another AI agent to resume development at a future point.
