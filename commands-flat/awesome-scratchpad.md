This repository is intended as a curated list of resources. I create these primarily for my own reference but they are public repos / open source on github.

I have used a scratchpad to note:

- the repos i wish to include 
- the sections 
- descriptions for the sections 
- observations 

Your task is to organise this data into a README.md or to add the new repos / projects to the existing one.

Follow these editing guidelines:

- Organisation is key: divide the repo into logical sections 
- Within each section, order the projects alphabetically, by name 

You can also note, or add a note if missing:

- The update date  
- This is not a definitive list. That is almost never possible. 
- For shields.io, use badges for View Repo, Star Count, Last Commit 

Add or integrate a TOC but don't make it so long that it takes over the presentation. Consider linking just to key sections.

Use horizontal lines to break / divide between sections (but not individual projects).

You can pull a short description of each repo using fetch. If the user has added their notes, synthesise the two data sources, combining the project's own description with the user's obesrvations (likewise for categories.)
