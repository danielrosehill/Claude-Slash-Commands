This repository is intended as a curated list of resources. I create these primarily for my own reference but they are public repos / open source on github.

I have used a scratchpad to note:

- the repos i wish to include 
- the sections 
- descriptions for the sections 
- observations 

Your task is to organize this data into a README.md or to add the new repos / projects to the existing one.

Follow these editing guidelines:

- Organization is key: divide the repo into logical sections 
- Within each section, order the projects alphabetically, by name 

You can also note, or add a note if missing:

- The update date  
- This is not a definitive list. That is almost never possible. 
- For shields.io, use badges for View Repo, Star Count, Last Commit 

## Additional Guidelines 

- Add or integrate a TOC but don't make it so long that it takes over the presentation. Consider linking just to key sections.
-  Use horizontal lines to break / divide between sections (but not individual projects).

You can pull a short description of each repo using fetch but consider running this as a script so that you don't need to prompt the user for every fetch you make. 

If the user has added their notes, synthesize the two data sources, combining the project's own description with the user's observations (likewise for categories.)

The user has aggregated these resources for a reason and will likely share why this collection matters. If they didn't, you may ask them.

Once you have integrated the repos from the scratchpad, delete the contents of the scratchpad.

Rename the repository names to make them easier to read. For example if you encounter gemini-mcp-server list that as Gemini MCP Server. The repo link, of course, preserves the actual repository name.
