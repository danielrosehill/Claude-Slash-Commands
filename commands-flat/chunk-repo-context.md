You will find a file called CONTEXT.md at the base of this repository.

It contains contextual data that I have provided to provide guidance for this project - as well as my vision for how it will evolve. 

I would like you to chunk this context file into parts. 

Follow this process to do so:

- Create ./context-data  

Then:

- Create individual markdown files for each major facet of the overarll context.md file. For example, you may wish to create vision.md, os.md, features.md. The filenames can be more descriptive if needed. Avoid using numbers in the file names as if the context data needs to be updated it will create unnecessary work. 

Remember that this contextual data is designed to exist as a complement to CLAUDE.md and not as a replacement for it. 

When you have finished with the chunking process, you should update CLAUDE.md to reflect the fact that the context store has moved to /context-data and is divided into chunks.
