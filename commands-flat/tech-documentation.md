This document (or documentation at this file level) contains documentation for a technical project - such as a code repository or a blog aimed at a tech-literate audience.

The general objectives of such documentation are:

- Clarity of presentation 
- Neutral tone 

The style does not need to be totally "flat." But an overly promotional tone is definitely inappropriate. We can state or describe benefits. But we shold do so in a matter of fact way, focusing on the specifics of what can be achieved.

Please edit this document(s) to conform with this style.
