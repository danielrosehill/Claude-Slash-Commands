This repository contains a file called context.md.

I use context.md to capture context data about projects that I am working on.

CLAUDE.md (as you know) is intended as an agent-readable file providing context data to the AI agent.

I would like you to do two things:

1: Read context.md (or similar filename). Lightly edit it for clarity: add missing paragraph spacing, punctuation; fix typos; add headings and subheadings to note flow.
 

2: Create CLAUDE.md. CLAUDE.md should be a condensed and clarified version of the context file that zones in on the key points from an AI agent's perspective. Include, in CLAUDE.md a note that there is longer form context data also available in the repo.
