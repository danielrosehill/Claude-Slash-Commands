This repository is a work in progress containing early notes or starter code for a project.

The user wishes to make this clear so visitors understand this is not a finished or production-ready resource.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add a WIP (Work in Progress) badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a yellow or orange color for the WIP badge to indicate incomplete status

Add this section near the top of the README (after any intro/description):
