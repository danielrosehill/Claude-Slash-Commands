Please go through the markdown files in this repository to make sure that no emojis have been used. If you find any emojis, remove them. If emojis have been used in place of proper icons, then identify an appropriate icon library that could be used to provide the emojis. Remember that if the icons are well known, such as the icons from major social networks, these should be integrated via a pre-designed library. Do not attempt to create custom once-off SVGs for any logo that likely already exists in a professional library.
