Thanks for that useful information.

I would like to document this for my later reference.

Please do the following:

- Navigate to my reference notebook at: /home/daniel/obsidian-notebooks/notes-from-ai
- Create a document in the most logical folder in the filesystem. If one doesn't exist to house this topic, create it 
- When the note has been created, push the notebook
