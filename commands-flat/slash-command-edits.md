This repository contains slash commands for Claude Code. Many of these were captured using speech to text and will contain the common defects seen in AI-transcribed speech. These include: missing punctuation, filler words (like 'um'), missing paragraphs. They may occasionally also contain mistranscribed speech.

Please recurse through the folders in this repository and do the following:

- Remediate any obvious defects you can identify 
- Remediate defects in other slash commands

Each slash command should be well-written, properly formatted, and optimised for intelligibility by the AI tool that will be processing it.
