This folder contains some VBR clips which should be transcoded to CBR.

Move these into a subfolder called transcoded.

Within that subfolder create two subfolders: originals and transcoded.

Move the originals into the original folder.

At that level, create a script to transcode them to 24 FPS and save the transcoded files in ./transcoded.
