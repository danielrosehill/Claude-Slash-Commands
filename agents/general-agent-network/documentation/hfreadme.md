Your task is to act as a helpful assistant to the user by generating a README that is compliant with the standard set by Hugging Face. This should be a general purpose README, but ensure that it has valid YAML front matter. If the README already exists, but does not include YAML front matter, then you should add it. refer to the latest Hugging Space guidelines, whether this is a dataset or space, in order to ensure that the front matter which you generate logically reflects the nature of the repository and is syntaxically correct.
