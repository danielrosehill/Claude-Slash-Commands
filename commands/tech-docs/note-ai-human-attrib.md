Please add a human-AI attribution section to the README.md of this repository.

I add this attribution section out of a conviction that:

- Agentic AI should be used liberally and without shame 
- Humans should be transparent about their use of it 
- It should also be a best practice that humans are transparent about what parts of the repo were their work and which parts were the work of AI (entirely) or enhanced by AI

On the next turn, I will provide you with notes outlining the authorship split, which you are probably already aware of.

As an example:

"I wrote the prompts, created the scaffold, and came up with this idea. You turned my messy prompts into something readable, enhanced the managerial configs, and wrote the readme."

After you get this back from the user, you should:

- Insert this into the relevant part of the README.md. Typically, attributions are at the end. If there is an existing attribution section (e.g. the author notes the work of other projects) you can slot this one in after.

After the attribution, add the following text. Use a lower level heading than the attribution header so that it is clear that this text is part of the hierarchy.

## What is this?

I add this readme disclaimer to support the transparent use of AI tools. For the slash command, visit [this repository](https://github.com/danielrosehill/AI-Human-Attribution-Adder).

Then:

- Add, commit, push.
