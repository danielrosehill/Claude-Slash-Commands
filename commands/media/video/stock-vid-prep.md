This folder contains video clips that are B roll. I may want to release some of them to an open source stock library. 

To help me do this:

-> Find any clips shorter than 5 seconds. Delete them. These are almost certaintly accidental recordings.

-> Remove the audio track from all the clips. 

-> Create HD and 4K subfolders. Move the clips into the folders according to their resolution.

-> Within each of those subfolders, create landscape and vertical subfolders. Move clips into the those based upon their orientation.
