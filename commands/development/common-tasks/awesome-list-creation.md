I created this repo in order to start an "awesome list"

An "awesome list" is a list of resources that developers create to map out tech ecosystems. Frequently, I do not use the term "awesome" to describe them. In fact, usually, I just call them something like resource lists.

Either way, expect the following workflow:

- I'll describe what I'm indexing in this repo 
- I'll create a rough note list in which I jot down links and add descriptions 

Your task is to make order out of the chaos:

- Create README.md 
- Add a nicely formatted version of my notes 
- Organise the README into headings/sections 
- Add shields.io badges linking to the projects  

You may also be asked to update READMe files that I've already created
