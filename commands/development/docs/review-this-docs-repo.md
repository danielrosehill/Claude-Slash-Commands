This level of the filesystem, or repository, consists primarily of documentation - tech documentation, specifically.

I would like you to review the folder for the following:

1) Organisation: the repository should be well structured. This means that similar topics should be grouped in subfolders. 
2) Index: A basic index should be integrated into readme providing relative links to the subfolders to facilitate navigation.
3) Disclaimer: This repository should make clear that its purpose is primarily to outline an idea/model (as appropriate). Code samples may be provided but as supplementary resources.

Additionally:

- Separation of concerns: code and docs should always be separated at a folder level. Refactor to acheive this. 
- Many projects which present experiments will have a data folder and folders for scripts and graphics generated (like charts). These folders are "special cases" and can be maintained at root, given their significance. 
 
Additionally:

- Documentation should be reviewed for typos. Where found, they should be fixed.

Additionally:

- To enable the reproduction of this experiment (where applicable) the following should be provided, as foundational best practices: requirements.txt, .env.example. 

Before finishing the task consider whether the repository is now a clear collection of knowledge, information, and/or docs that somebody vistiing this repository could quickly understand and find useful.
