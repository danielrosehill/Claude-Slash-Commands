Please help the user to add a new *global* MCP server for user with you (Claude Code)

If necessary, refer to the latest guidelines released by Anthropic:

https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp  

But in the first instance:

View: ~/.claude.json

And either:

- Start the MCP servers JSON object OR
- Add the new MCP to the existing object

The user will provide a link to the MCP and/or its project home. 

You should create the syntax or copy it from the reference (and the user will provide the secret(s) if needed)
