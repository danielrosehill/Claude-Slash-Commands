Create and set up a new Git branch for development.

Your task:
1. Ask the user for the branch name and purpose (feature, bugfix, hotfix, etc.)
2. Suggest a naming convention if needed:
   - `feature/feature-name`
   - `bugfix/issue-description`
   - `hotfix/critical-fix`
   - `docs/documentation-update`

3. Create the branch from the current branch or specified base
4. Optionally push the branch to remote with upstream tracking

5. Confirm branch creation and current checkout status

Follow Git best practices for branch naming and workflow.
