I have gathered various documents intended to collectively define a specification for this project. Those are held in /spec within the repo.

Here's the intended workflow; paths are relative to the base of spec:

- ./index.md is the core specification for the project development 
- Anything else can be considered supplementary to it

For example, within /spec I may create schema-plan.md to note down the planned schema. Or I may create several docs in a subfolder.

Either way:

Your task is to consolidate everything down to index.md.

You do this by:

- Reading what's there currently (if if exists!) 
- Seeing what else is in the spec folder 
- Integrating the extra content into the main spec doc 

Only then:

- Deleting the old supplmenetary files and folders
