Please organise the repository according to the following set of instructions:

The non-code elements in the repository (clustered around the base of the repo) should be organised.

Group similar elements into a common folder structure. For example, rather than have loose docs at the repo base, you might create a folder called docs and move the loose docs into them. 

Likewise, group and aggregate project notes, developer reference material, etc. 

Do not, however, make any filesystem edits to the code-containing directory.
