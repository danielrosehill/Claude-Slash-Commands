This repository is an indexing repository - I create these to gather together links to various repos that I create around a common theme.

Add a shields.io markdown badge near the top of the readme saying Indexing Repo

Add, also, a link to my master index as a markdown badge:

Add as a section in the README, near the bottom

## Indexing Repository

This repository is an indexing repository. I create indexing repos to consolidate links to individual repos which I create around a common theme and update these periodically. For a top level index, this is my [master index](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index). Thanks for visiting!
