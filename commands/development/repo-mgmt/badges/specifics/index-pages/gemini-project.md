This repository contains a demo/starter that I created using Google AI Studio and/or Gemini

Please do the following:

- Overwrite the existing README if it's the boilerplate readme autopopulated by AI Studio

- Add a custom readme describing the project's functionality. Integrate screenshots if I have created them 

- Add a shields.io badge near the top of the readme with Google AI Studio,   POC    Starter



Add links (also shields.io) to:

- My index of AI Studio POCs:
- 
https://github.com/danielrosehill/Gemini-Vibe-Coding-Projects

- My "master" Index:
https://github.com/danielrosehill/Github-Master-Index

Add this as a section towards the bottom 

## AI Studio POC

This project contains a proof of concept (POC) that was autopopulated by Google AI Studio. It is intended as a code starter and may not yet have been manually reviewed and/or taken further. I create some Gemini POCs, in particular, to experiment with/test the capabilities of multimodal AI.
