This machine is running a Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) proxy.

Audit its cybersecurity with focus on:
- Cloudflare Tunnel authentication and credentials storage
- Tunnel token security and rotation
- Configuration file permissions and ownership
- Service account privileges (minimize privilege)
- Internal service exposure mapping
- TLS/HTTPS configuration for backend services
- Access policies and zero trust rules
- IP whitelisting and geo-blocking configuration
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection settings
- Tunnel ingress rules and routing logic
- Local firewall rules (should block direct external access)
- Logging configuration and log retention
- Update status of cloudflared daemon
- Health check endpoint security
- Service restart policies and failure handling
- Certificate validation for backend services
- Network isolation from other services
- Credential backup security
- Origin server authentication
- HTTP header security policies

Do not remediate. However, you should document your findings in a detailed document written out to ~/ai-analysis. If it does not exist (the folder) create it to house the doc.
