This repository contains system prompts for AI systems.

Your task is as follows:

- Review the prompts written by the user  
- Rewrite any aspects that make the prompts specific only to the user or their immediate context  

For example:

If you encounter a prompt that contains: "You are a friendly assistant who helps Daniel," then you would rewrite this as "You are a friendly assistant who helps the user ..."

If you found: "You are a restaurant recommendation agent who helps to find great restaurant experiences for Daniel in Jerusalem."

Then you would rewrite this as:

"You are a restaurant recommendation agent who helps to find great resaurants for the user in their local environment."

You may remediate basic defects in the prompts you encounter (like a lack of spacing or punctuation). But make no other edits.
