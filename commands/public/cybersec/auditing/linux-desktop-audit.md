This machine is a Linux desktop workstation.

Audit its cybersecurity with focus on:
- User account security and privilege escalation risks
- Desktop environment vulnerabilities (X11/Wayland security)
- Installed applications and package sources
- Network services exposed on the desktop
- Firewall configuration (ufw, firewalld, iptables)
- Browser security and extension risks
- Peripheral device access controls
- File permissions in user directories
- SSH configuration if enabled
- Bluetooth and wireless security
- Automatic updates configuration
- Screen lock and session management
- Keyring and credential storage security

Do not remediate. However, you should document your findings in a detailed document written out to ~/ai-analysis. If it does not exist (the folder) create it to house the doc.
