This folder contains video clips that were used in a video project and which the user is now releasing to a public stock library, for free. 

To save the user time in sorting through the clips, do the following:

- Delete any clips of less than 5 seconds duration. You may determine duration by a CLI or file size. 
- Identify whether any of the files have a variable frame rate. If so, transcode to 24FPS
