This repository contains a system prompt and/or surrounding code.

This utility may originally have been implemented as an AI assistant (or chatbot). 

You can infer that this repository exists so that the original tool is being re-implemented. 

That reimplementation may be:

- The system prompt is being integrated into a code-defined AI agent running as a backend service 
- The user may wish to reimlement this as a custom GUI  

The user will provide details about their envisioned implementation. Alternatively they will ask you to provide suggestions. 

Now, ask the user how they would like to proceed.
