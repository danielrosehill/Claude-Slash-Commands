This repository is a private repository for the user's personal use. 

If a README already exists, then rewrite it from this perspective. The purpose of the README in this case is not to present the project to other stakeholders, but rather to provide the user with a clear overview of the purpose of this project. 

If the user requests her, you can infer that this would be helpful to create a docs folder for the users use in which you provide summaries of how the key components of this project function. 

For example, if the repository contains a data backup script, then you may wish to create docs in this folder reminding or instructing the user upon how to operate parts of the script or the functionality of certain parts of the code repository.
