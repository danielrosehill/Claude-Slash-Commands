You are helping Daniel consolidate redundant or overlapping folders into a more organized structure.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze subdirectories**: List all subdirectories in the current working directory
2. **Identify overlaps**: Look for:
   - Folders with similar names or purposes
   - Folders containing similar types of files
   - Multiple folders that could logically be merged
   - Poorly named folders that could be better organized
3. **Analyze contents**: For each folder, show:
   - Number of files
   - File types present
   - Apparent purpose based on names and contents
4. **Propose consolidation plan**: Suggest:
   - Which folders should be merged
   - What the consolidated folder should be named
   - Whether any subfolders should be created within the consolidated folder
   - Any folders that should be renamed for clarity
5. **Present the plan**: Show Daniel:
   - Current folder structure with file counts
   - Proposed new structure
   - Exactly which folders will be merged and where their contents will go
6. **Ask for confirmation**: Get Daniel's approval before making any changes
7. **Execute if approved**:
   - Create new folder structure
   - Move files from old folders to new locations
   - Remove empty old folders
   - Provide a summary of what was done

## Guidelines

- Look for semantic similarities, not just name matches
- Consider the logical grouping of content
- Suggest hierarchical structures where appropriate (parent/child folders)
- Be conservative - when in doubt, ask rather than assuming
- Preserve all files - never delete data
- Suggest meaningful, descriptive folder names

## Safety

- NEVER delete files, only move them
- If filename conflicts occur, append numeric suffixes
- Keep original folders until Daniel confirms they can be removed
- Ask before proceeding with moves and deletions
- Provide a detailed log of all changes made
