Plan and execute repository refactoring while maintaining functionality.

Your task:
1. Analyze current repository structure:
   - File organization
   - Code architecture
   - Naming conventions
   - Dependencies
   - Technical debt

2. Identify refactoring needs:
   - Poor separation of concerns
   - Duplicated code
   - Unclear naming
   - Circular dependencies
   - Outdated patterns

3. Create refactoring plan:
   ```markdown
   ## Refactoring Plan

   ### Goals
   - Improve code organization
   - Reduce technical debt
   - Enhance maintainability

   ### Proposed Changes
   1. Restructure folders:
      - Move utilities to src/utils/
      - Separate components from pages
      - Create dedicated config directory

   2. Code improvements:
      - Extract repeated logic into utilities
      - Rename unclear variables/functions
      - Break down large files

   3. Update dependencies:
      - Remove unused packages
      - Update outdated libraries
      - Fix security vulnerabilities

   ### Risk Assessment
   - Breaking changes: [None/Low/Medium/High]
   - Test coverage: [%]
   - Rollback plan: [Strategy]
   ```

4. Execute refactoring:
   - Make changes incrementally
   - Test after each change
   - Update imports and references
   - Fix broken paths
   - Update documentation

5. Verify functionality:
   - Run tests
   - Check for broken references
   - Validate build process
   - Test key features

Seek user input before major structural changes. Maintain repository functionality throughout refactoring.
