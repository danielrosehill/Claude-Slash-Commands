Proofread and fact-check the provided text or files in this repository.

Your task:
1. Verify all facts, statistics, dates, names, and claims
2. Correct any inaccuracies found
3. Insert precise inline Markdown links `[anchor text](URL)` for any claim that should be sourced
4. If a claim cannot be verified after diligent search, append `[source needed]` after it

Source selection hierarchy:
- Primary/official sources (official websites, statutes, standards bodies, datasets, DOIs)
- Peer-reviewed literature and reputable preprints
- High-quality secondary sources (.gov, .edu, major journals, authoritative news)
- Reputable reports with transparent methods

Guidelines:
- Preserve the original structure, headings, lists, tables, and code blocks
- Use concise, factual anchor text (e.g., `[ISO/IEC 27001]`, `[2024 WHO report]`)
- Never use "here" or "click here" as anchor text
- Link the first occurrence of a recurring fact; re-link only when context demands
- When sources conflict, choose the highest-tier, most recent, jurisdiction-relevant source
- Return only the revised text with corrections and links applied
