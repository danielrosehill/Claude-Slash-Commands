Apply minimal, high-precision SEO edits to improve organic search performance.

Your task:
1. Enhance discoverability and relevance with subtle, natural edits
2. Improve keyword placement without keyword stuffing
3. Optimize headings and subheadings for search intent
4. Ensure meta-friendly structure (clear hierarchy, scannable content)
5. Improve internal linking opportunities where natural

Constraints:
- Do NOT alter material flow, voice, tone, or narrative structure
- Keep edits minimal and human-natural
- Preserve the original message and style
- Focus on discoverability, not dramatic rewrites

Apply changes directly while maintaining the text's authenticity.
