Add the README.md

Do:

- Summarise clearly and simply the purpose of this project/codebase as you can infer it. You may use the understanding of the repository you have built up during this session, or in prior memory, to supplement your current indexing

- Use shields.io badges sparingly to visually identify languages and components used

- Prefer markdown tables over bullet point lists. When adding a table of repositories, use shields.io badges for linking to the repos 

- Add internal links on README.md by adding relative links that will be navigable when visited on github.com 

DO NOT:

- Use emojis! 
- Add a contributor guidelines section (unless otherwise stated)
- Add a license or make any note of licensing.
- Include navigable links to any parts of the repository which are deliberately not commited: for example if there's a folder called /private, don't mention it or add links to it
