Organise the filesystem at the current level.

Undertake the following operations:

> Identify if there are folders that serve almost the same purpose. For example, if you see a folder called ai and AI these can be grouped into just AI
> Identify if similar folders could be grouped into parent folders with a category name 
> If there are loose files (files without a folder) then move them into the most appropriate parent folder and/or delete them (if they are temporary or empty)

The objective is to clean up and organise the folder structure to make it easier for the user to use.
