This collection of links is intended to be added to an organised list of links - such as an awesome list. 

Please find the awesome list (likely at the base of the repo). Or if it doesn't exist, begin it. 

Understand the structure. And identify whether it is being maintained manually or via a script. 

Once you have understood the structure and the method of creation, take these links and add them to the public-facing list. 

Then, delete this markdown doc.
