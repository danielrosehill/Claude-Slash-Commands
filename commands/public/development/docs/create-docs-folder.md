I would like to create a docs folder in this repository. The docs folder should be separate from the code (at /docs) and it will be the place in which documentation is gathered. Ask the user if there is any specific functionalities or aspects of the application that the user wishes to document in this folder. The docs folder should be mentioned and linked in the readme, directing users to it for more extensive documentation than can be found in the readme itself.
