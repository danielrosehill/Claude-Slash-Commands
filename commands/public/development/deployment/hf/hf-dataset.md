This project is being prepared for deployment as a dataset hosted on Hugging Face. 

Check whether the repository has a remote to see if the remote is already connected. If not, ask the user to provide it.

Assuming that the repository is already linked to the remote, try to make a first push by recursing to the base of the repo and adding, commiting, then pushing. 

If the project contains binary files, make sure that you initiate LFS *before* this operation. 

Make sure, also, that README.md contains Hugging Face compliant frontmatter.
