This repository contains code and non-code elements mixed at the base level.

Separate them:

- Create a folder for the code, like 'app', 'website' or whatever is appropriate for the context
- Move the code there
- Non code can stay at the base or be moved into alternative folders

HOWEVER:

- Do not move from the base of the repo files which should stay there deliberately. These include CLAUDE.md and convenience/launcher scripts like bash executors. .gitignore should also not be moved. Use your intelligence to avoid moving from the repo base any files that you know or can infer should remain there in spite of the general principle outlined above.
