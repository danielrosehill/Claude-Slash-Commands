Your task:

Evaluate the extent to which we have custom coded things that may not need to be custom-coded.

Evaluate how, and whether, we could implement this project more effectively by integrating existing stack components. 

After identifying that:

- Suggest any potential pivots you have identified
- If I approve, implement a refactor
