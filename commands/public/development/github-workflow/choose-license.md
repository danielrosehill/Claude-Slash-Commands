Your task:
1. Ask the user about their licensing requirements:
   - Restrictions they want to impose
   - Freedoms they want to grant
   - Attribution requirements
   - Commercial use preferences
   - Derivative works stance

2. Based on their requirements, recommend the most suitable license:
   - **MIT**: Permissive, allows commercial use with attribution
   - **Apache 2.0**: Permissive with patent grant
   - **GPL-3.0**: Copyleft, requires derivative works to use same license
   - **BSD**: Permissive with various clause options
   - **Creative Commons**: For non-software content

3. If the user agrees with the recommendation:
   - Create LICENSE file with the chosen license
   - Update README to mention the license
   - Add license badge to README (optional)

Present options clearly and explain implications of each license choice.
