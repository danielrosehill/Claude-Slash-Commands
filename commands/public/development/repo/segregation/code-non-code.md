Please help to reorganise the repository according to the following instruction:

- Code and non-code should be nested within separate top level folders

If the code-containing folder is already attached to a deployment pipeline, don't change its name without express confirmation from me. 

Otherwise, ensure that all code is nested within a top level folder suitable for the project. For example, create "site" for a website. 

Aggregate non-code under descriptive top level folders like "docs" or "project-notes" (etc). Try to organise and group these within the non-code  hierarchy.
