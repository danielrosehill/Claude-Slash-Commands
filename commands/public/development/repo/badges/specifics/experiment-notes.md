This repository contains notes and results from an experiment.

The user wishes to make this clear so visitors understand this is documentation of experimental work rather than production code.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add an Experiment badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a color like yellow or orange for the experiment badge to indicate exploratory/research nature

Add this section near the top of the README (after any intro):
