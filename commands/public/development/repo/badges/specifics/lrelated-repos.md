This repository is part of a group of repositories. 

The user would like to add a "Related Repos" section to both make that clear and make it easier for browsers to find the connected parts of this project.

Here's the approach you should take:

- Ask the user to provide the list of related repos. Alternatively the user will provide these one by one. 

Once you've got the list:

- Add a related repos section towards the bottom of README.md
- List the related repos alphabetically, unless the user has requested an alternative method
-  Add the links as github repo badges wit shields.io
