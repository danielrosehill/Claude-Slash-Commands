Please help the user to add a *project level* MCP server within this repo

If necessary, refer to the latest guidelines released by Anthropic:

https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp  

But in the first instance:

Create a .mcp.json at the base of this repo and either:

- Start the JSON object
- Add the new MCP to the existing object

The user will provide a link to the MCP and/or its project home. You should create the syntax or copy it from the reference (and the user will provide the secret(s) if needed)
