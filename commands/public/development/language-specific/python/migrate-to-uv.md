This Python project was created using a pip venv

I would like to switch over to uv

Work through this task list:

- Write out requirements.txt if it doesn't exist 
- Install with uv  
- Create a bash script for installing the venv  using uv 
- Delete any residual code from previous venvs that is no longer needed
