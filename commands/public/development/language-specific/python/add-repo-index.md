I would like you to add an index to this repository that users can navigate on Github.com (to do this, use relative links).

This index should be:

- Created programmatically 
- Created incrementally, if possible

Follow this general preference:

- The index is created by a script as a standalone file 
- That file is injected into README.md using injection markers 

The script to generate the index, once validated, can be implemented as a pre push hook
