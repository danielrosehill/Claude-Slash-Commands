Please set up a task management system within this repo

Firstly, verify that it does not already exist (if it does, this was my mistake).

Assuming that it does not, however:

Create it at 

/repo-mgmt/tasks (relative to the base of the repo)

And add as subfolders

to-do
done
in-progress

Add a .gitkeep to each subfolder
