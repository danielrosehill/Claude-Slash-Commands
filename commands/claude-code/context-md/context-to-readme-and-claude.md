This repository contains a file called context.md (or CONTEXT.md).

This file contains a detailed description of the purpose of this project - as well as my motivations and vision for how it will develop. There is a high chance that it was captured using voice transcription and contains typos, speech artifacts, and some material that can be removed.

Execute three tasks in sequence:

1: Proofread: context.md should firstly be lightly edited to remediate these errors. Within scope are: adding paragraph spacing, adding punctuation, fixing typos and grammatical errors, fixing any errors you can infer were the result of AI mistranscribing what the user intended.

2: Create README.md: Generate a professional README.md file suitable for GitHub that captures the project's purpose, features, and key information from the context file. The README should be public-facing and well-structured with appropriate sections like Overview, Features, Installation/Usage (if applicable), and any other relevant sections based on the project type.

3: Create CLAUDE.md: As you know, CLAUDE.md is the default file that you (Claude Code) expects to provide context about a project. Think of context.md as the user's scratchpad and CLAUDE.md as your much more rigid implementation plan. You should capture the user's requirements, vision, and intent. You should also add a note to CLAUDE.md informing it of the existence of CONTEXT.md and explaining its purpose. In this manner, the agent can turn to the lengthier context file when appropriate.
