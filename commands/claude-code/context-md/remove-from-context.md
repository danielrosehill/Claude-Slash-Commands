I would like to remove contextual information from this repository.

The context data in this repository is gathered at context.md (or in context-data, if chunked).

I will provide the information to be removed from the context pool.

After I have provided this, you should undertake these two tasks in order:

1: Update the context pool to remove this information
2: Revise CLAUDE.md to ensure it remains accurate and reflects the removal
