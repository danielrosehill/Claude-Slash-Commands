This project contains a voice note called spec.mp3 (or another audio file type). This audio file is a voice recording in which the user has detailed the context about the project that they are working on.

Here is your task:

1: "Listen" to the audio; obtain a first pass transcription

Then:

2: Create spec.md. This should be a specification outlining the functionalities that the user has outlined in the recording. Spec.md should be suitable for its intended purpose of instructing an AI agent in developing the project. 

3: Create context.md. If you can identify aspects of the recording that, rather than providing immediately required spec directions, provided surrounding context, then add these to context.md (creating if it doesn't exist).

4: Create or update CLAUDE.md. CLAUDE.md is the overarching set of context and directions for Claude Code. Keep it as light as possible but provide key info from the recording.

Once you have completed these tasks, you may delete the audio binary from the project.
