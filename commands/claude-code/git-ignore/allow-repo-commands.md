Please add the project level slash commands at ./claude/commands to be publicly shared.

As I have a global git ignore rule preventing .claude from pushing to repos we will need to add a specific override for only this folder at the project level .gitignore (create if missing).

Verify that the commands are being picked up in version control after adding and fix any retrospective blocks.
