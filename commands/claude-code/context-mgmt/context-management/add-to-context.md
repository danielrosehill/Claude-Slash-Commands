I would like to add new contextual information to this repository.

The context data in this repository is gathered at context.md (or in context-data, if chunked).

I will provide the new context which adds new information to the context pool.

After I have provided this, you should undertake these two tasks in order:

1: Update the context pool to add in this new information 
2: Revise CLAUDE.md to ensure it remains accurate
