This folder contains files with various filenames.

Please standardise files of the same format on the most recurrent filename type. For example, if you encounter a folder with 10 PNGs and 2 JPGs you would convert the 2 JPG to PNG.

Then:

Rename all files sequentially from whatever they are named as to 1.png, 2.png etc (substituting for the prevalent filetype).
