Generate innovative solutions to complex problems from a fresh perspective.

Your task:
1. Understand the problem deeply:
   - What has been tried already
   - Why traditional approaches failed
   - Constraints and limitations
   - Desired outcomes
   - Acceptance criteria

2. Challenge assumptions:
   - Question requirements
   - Identify hidden constraints
   - Find overlooked opportunities
   - Consider alternative framing

3. Apply creative problem-solving techniques:

   **Lateral Thinking:**
   - Approach from unexpected angles
   - Combine unrelated concepts
   - Reverse the problem

   **First Principles:**
   - Break down to fundamental truths
   - Rebuild solution from scratch
   - Question every assumption

   **Analogical Thinking:**
   - How is this solved in other domains?
   - What can we learn from nature?
   - Cross-industry inspiration

   **Constraint Removal:**
   - What if budget was unlimited?
   - What if we had perfect data?
   - What if we could rewrite everything?
   - Then work backward to reality

4. Generate unconventional solutions:
   ```markdown
   ## Fresh Perspective Solutions

   ### Traditional Approach
   [What was tried and why it failed]

   ### Fresh Angle 1: Invert the Problem
   Instead of [X], what if we [opposite of X]?
   - Rationale: [Why this could work]
   - Implementation: [How to do it]
   - Risks: [What to watch out for]

   ### Fresh Angle 2: Borrow from [Other Domain]
   In [industry/field], they solve similar problems by [method]
   - Adaptation: [How to apply here]
   - Benefits: [Why this is better]

   ### Fresh Angle 3: Simplify Radically
   What if we removed [major component]?
   - Alternative: [Simpler approach]
   - Trade-offs: [What we gain vs. lose]
   ```

5. Evaluate feasibility and impact:
   - Quick wins vs. long-term solutions
   - Resource requirements
   - Risk assessment
   - Potential ROI

Use when traditional approaches have hit dead ends. Think creatively and question everything.
