This repository contains an open-sourced Obsidian notebook/vault.

The user wishes to make this clear to visitors who might be expecting a code repository.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add an Obsidian Vault badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a purple/violet color scheme for the badge (Obsidian's brand color)

Add this section towards the middle or bottom of the README:
