This repository contains a folder structure scaffold/skeleton for others to use.

The user wishes to make this clear so visitors understand this provides an organizational structure template.

Here's how you can help make this repo's purpose clear:

- Add a Scaffold badge using shields.io near the top of the README. If a badge line already exists, add it there.
- Use a color like orange or purple for the scaffold badge

Add this section near the top of the README (after any intro/description):
