This repository's readme contains links to other repos 

Please implement the following changes:

- If the links are relative links to paths in *this* repo, use shields.io to create a View Folder badge and replace the textual link with this  
-  If the links are extenral links to Github repos (whether they're my own or others'), use shields.iod to create a View Repo badge and replace the textual link 
-  If the links are to Hugging Face datasets/models/spaces create the applicable shields.io badge

The objective is to make the index a little easier to read. Use a consistent style for the badges you add.
