# Notes to Outline Converter

Transform raw, unstructured notes into clear, organized outlines ready for writing, presenting, or further development. Perfect for turning brainstorming sessions, research notes, meeting minutes, or scattered thoughts into coherent structure.

## Your Task

Take the user's messy, unorganized notes and create a well-structured outline that:
- Identifies main themes and topics
- Groups related ideas logically
- Establishes clear hierarchy
- Eliminates redundancy
- Reveals gaps or areas needing development
- Creates a framework for further work

## Note Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Assessment

Examine the notes to understand:
- **Format**: Bullets, paragraphs, fragments, mixed?
- **Content type**: Research, brainstorming, meeting notes, lecture notes?
- **Completeness**: Are there gaps or unclear references?
- **Redundancy**: Are ideas repeated in different ways?
- **Implicit structure**: Is there a hidden organization waiting to emerge?

### 2. Identify Major Themes

Look for:
- **Recurring topics**: Ideas mentioned multiple times
- **Natural groupings**: Related concepts that belong together
- **Implied categories**: Unstated but obvious organizational schemes
- **Key questions**: Central problems or inquiries
- **Action items**: Things to be done

**Example Raw Notes**:
```
- need to improve onboarding
- new hires confused about tools
- documentation is outdated
- mentor program?
- Sarah mentioned buddy system at previous company
- first week should include setup day
- update wiki with current process
- video tutorials for tools
- checklist for managers
- 30-60-90 day goals
```

**Identified Themes**:
- Current problems (confusion, outdated docs)
- Solutions - documentation (wiki, videos)
- Solutions - social (mentoring, buddy system)
- Solutions - structure (checklists, timeline)

### 3. Group and Organize

Cluster related notes together:

**Grouping Strategies**:

**A. Chronological**: When notes involve sequence or timeline
```
## Onboarding Timeline
### Week 1
- Setup day for tools and access
- Meet buddy/mentor
- ...
```

**B. Categorical**: When notes fall into distinct categories
```
## Improving Onboarding

### Documentation Issues
- Wiki outdated
- Need video tutorials
- ...

### Social Support
- Buddy system (per Sarah)
- Mentor program
- ...
```

**C. Problem-Solution**: When notes address challenges
```
## Onboarding Improvements

### Problems
- New hires confused about tools
- Documentation outdated
- ...

### Solutions
- Update wiki
- Create video tutorials
- Implement buddy system
- ...
```

**D. Priority-based**: When notes have implied importance
```
## Onboarding Project

### High Priority (Do First)
- Update documentation
- Create setup checklist

### Medium Priority
- Develop video tutorials
- Formalize buddy system

### Long-term
- Build comprehensive mentor program
```

### 4. Establish Hierarchy

Determine levels of importance:

**Top Level (H2 ##)**: Major topics or sections
**Second Level (H3 ###)**: Subtopics or main points
**Third Level (bullets)**: Supporting details
**Fourth Level (sub-bullets)**: Specific examples or notes

**Hierarchical Principles**:
- General to specific
- Big picture to details
- Main ideas to supporting points
- Categories to items

### 5. Fill in Structure

Add necessary organizational elements:

**Add clarifying headers**:
Transform vague groupings into clear labels

Raw: "Stuff about tools"
Outline: "### Required Tools and Setup"

**Create transitions**:
Show how sections relate

**Sequence indicators**:
Number steps when order matters

**Context notes**:
Add brief clarifying notes in [brackets] for unclear items

### 6. Identify Gaps

Note where information is missing:

```
## Marketing Strategy

### Target Audience
- Small businesses
- [Need: specific industry focus?]
- Budget range: $10k-$50k annually

### Channels
- Social media
- [Need: which platforms?]
- [Need: content strategy]
```

## Handling Different Note Types

### Brainstorming Notes (Stream of Consciousness)

**Characteristics**:
- Random order
- Repeated ideas in different forms
- Half-thoughts and fragments
- Questions mixed with ideas

**Processing**:
1. Extract distinct ideas (merge duplicates)
2. Group by theme
3. Organize by logical flow
4. Convert questions into topics to explore

**Example**:

Raw notes:
```
maybe we should redesign the homepage, it's confusing, users bounce too fast, what if we had a video?, demo video could help, or maybe just clearer CTA, yeah the CTA is buried, make it pop more, colors?, also the nav is complicated, too many options, simplify nav, homepage video idea again, could show product in action
```

Outline:
```
## Homepage Redesign

### Problems Identified
- High bounce rate
- Confusing layout
- Unclear call-to-action
- Complicated navigation

### Proposed Solutions

#### Call-to-Action Improvements
- Increase prominence (color, size, position)
- Clearer messaging

#### Navigation Simplification
- Reduce number of options
- Better organization

#### Add Demo Video
- Show product in action
- Place prominently on homepage
- [Need: decide on length, content]
```

### Research Notes (Facts and Sources)

**Characteristics**:
- References and citations
- Quotes and excerpts
- Mixed sources
- Factual data

**Processing**:
1. Group by topic/theme
2. Note sources [in brackets]
3. Distinguish facts from interpretation
4. Create evidence-based structure

**Example**:

Raw notes:
```
Smith 2020: "productivity dropped 15% in first 3 months of remote work"
Johnson article: managers reported communication difficulties
Remote work study - 67% positive about flexibility
Same study - 45% felt isolated
Virtual meetings increased 300% (TechCrunch)
Smith also mentioned adaptation period - after 6 months productivity recovered
```

Outline:
```
## Remote Work Research Findings

### Productivity Impact
- Initial drop: 15% decline in first 3 months [Smith 2020]
- Recovery: Returns to baseline after 6-month adaptation [Smith 2020]

### Communication Challenges
- Managers report difficulties [Johnson]
- Virtual meetings increased 300% [TechCrunch]

### Employee Satisfaction
- Flexibility: 67% positive [Remote Work Study]
- Isolation concern: 45% felt isolated [Remote Work Study]
```

### Meeting Notes (Discussions and Decisions)

**Characteristics**:
- Mix of discussion and decisions
- Action items
- Questions raised
- Multiple speakers/perspectives

**Processing**:
1. Separate decisions from discussion
2. Extract action items
3. Note owners for tasks
4. Flag open questions

**Example**:

Raw notes:
```
Discussed Q4 budget - need to cut 10%
Sarah suggested reducing conference budget
Mike disagrees, conferences are important for leads
Decision: cut travel budget by 15% instead
Action: Tom will revise budget proposal
Question: what about hiring freeze?
Will discuss hiring in next meeting
Lisa will prepare hiring impact analysis
Also talked about new CRM - postponed to January
```

Outline:
```
## Q4 Budget Meeting Notes

### Decisions Made
- Cut travel budget by 15%
- Postpone CRM implementation to January

### Action Items
- [ ] Tom: Revise budget proposal with travel cuts

  - Deferred to next meeting
  - Awaiting Lisa's impact analysis
```

### Lecture/Learning Notes (Educational Content)

**Characteristics**:
- Definitions and concepts
- Examples
- Formulas or procedures
- Key points from instructor

**Processing**:
1. Extract main concepts
2. Group supporting details under each
3. Note examples
4. Highlight important definitions

## Outline Quality Checklist

A good outline should:

✓ **Logical organization**: Ideas flow naturally

## Example Transformation

**Raw Notes**:
```
CI/CD important for modern dev
continuous integration = automated testing when code pushed
prevents bugs from reaching production
GitHub Actions popular
also CircleCI
Jenkins more complex but powerful
CD = continuous deployment, automates releases
reduces manual errors in deployment
need good test coverage for CI to work
heard you need 80% coverage minimum
faster feedback on code quality
catches integration issues early
whole team needs to commit to practice
doesn't work if people skip the pipeline
```

**Organized Outline**:
```
# CI/CD in Modern Development
