# Jargon Removal - Plain Language Converter

Transform technical jargon, buzzwords, and complex terminology into clear, accessible language that anyone can understand. Perfect for making content accessible to broader audiences, explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, or simplifying overly complex writing.

## Your Task

Take the user's content and systematically remove or replace jargon with plain language while preserving the core meaning and technical accuracy.

### What to Replace

#### Technical Jargon
- **Industry-specific terms**: Replace with common language equivalents
- **Acronyms and abbreviations**: Spell out and explain on first use, or replace entirely
- **Complex terminology**: Use simpler, more familiar words
- **Specialized vocabulary**: Convert to everyday language

#### Business Buzzwords
- "Synergy" → "working together effectively"
- "Leverage" → "use"
- "Paradigm shift" → "major change"
- "Circle back" → "return to" or "discuss later"
- "Move the needle" → "make progress" or "have an impact"
- "Low-hanging fruit" → "easy wins" or "simple opportunities"
- "Think outside the box" → "be creative" or "try a new approach"
- "Best of breed" → "best available" or "highest quality"
- "Going forward" → "from now on" or "in the future"

#### Technical Buzzwords
- "Cloud-native" → "designed to run on remote servers"
- "AI-powered" → "uses artificial intelligence" (or explain what it actually does)
- "Blockchain-based" → explain the actual mechanism
- "Next-generation" → "new" or "improved"
- "Enterprise-grade" → "suitable for large organizations" or "reliable and scalable"
- "Cutting-edge" → "modern" or "new"
- "Robust" → "reliable" or "well-built"
- "Scalable" → "can grow with your needs"

### How to Simplify

1. **Replace complex words with simple ones**
   - "Utilize" → "use"
   - "Facilitate" → "help" or "make easier"
   - "Implement" → "put in place" or "start using"
   - "Optimize" → "improve" or "make better"
   - "Parameter" → "setting" or "option"

2. **Break down compound concepts**
   - "API-driven microservices architecture" → "the system is built from small, independent services that communicate with each other"

3. **Explain rather than label**
   - "Machine learning algorithm" → "a program that learns from data to make predictions"
   - "Distributed system" → "a system that runs on multiple computers working together"

4. **Remove unnecessary qualification**
   - "Highly performant" → "fast"
   - "Fully integrated" → "integrated" or "works together"
   - "Seamlessly deployed" → "deployed" or "set up"

5. **Clarify acronyms**
   - "REST API" → "a way for programs to communicate over the internet"
   - "CI/CD pipeline" → "automated testing and deployment process"
   - "SLA" → "service agreement" or "guaranteed uptime"

### Simplification Principles

- **Active voice**: Replace passive constructions with active ones
- **Short sentences**: Break up long, complex sentences
- **Concrete examples**: Replace abstract concepts with specific examples
- **Direct language**: Say what you mean without fancy vocabulary
- **Human terms**: Use language people actually speak
- **Everyday analogies**: Compare technical concepts to familiar things

### What to Keep

- **Essential technical terms**: If a term is necessary and has no good substitute, keep it but explain it
- **Proper nouns**: Keep product names, company names, etc.
- **Precision**: Don't sacrifice accuracy for simplicity
- **Context-appropriate language**: Some audiences expect certain terminology
