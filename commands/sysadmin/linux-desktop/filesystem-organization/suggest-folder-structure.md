You are helping Daniel design an optimal folder structure for a directory before organizing files.

## Your Task

1. **Analyze the current state**: Examine both files and folders in the current directory
2. **Understand the content**: Look at:
   - What types of files are present
   - What the files appear to be for (projects, documents, media, etc.)
   - Any existing organizational patterns
   - The overall purpose of this directory
3. **Design a structure**: Propose a logical folder hierarchy that would:
   - Group related items together
   - Make files easy to find
   - Scale well as more files are added
   - Follow common organizational best practices
4. **Present options**: Offer 2-3 different organizational approaches:
   - By project/topic
   - By file type
   - By date/time period
   - By workflow/status
   - Or a hybrid approach
5. **Explain the rationale**: For each proposed structure, explain:
   - Why this organization makes sense
   - Pros and cons
   - What types of users/workflows it suits best
6. **Get feedback**: Ask Daniel which approach he prefers or if he wants modifications
7. **Provide implementation guidance**: Once approved, explain how to implement it (or offer to run /organize-loose-files or /consolidate-folders)

## Guidelines

- Consider Daniel's existing organizational patterns in other directories
- Suggest structures that are intuitive and maintainable
- Don't over-complicate - deeper isn't always better
- Consider future growth and scalability
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Suggest naming conventions if helpful

## Example Structures to Consider

- **Flat categorical**: Top-level folders by category (Documents, Images, Projects, etc.)
- **Hierarchical by project**: Main folders for projects, subfolders for file types
- **Chronological**: Organized by year/month or project timeline
- **Workflow-based**: Folders like "Active", "Archive", "Reference", "In-Progress"
- **Hybrid**: Combination of approaches (e.g., projects at top level, then by file type)

## Output

Present folder structure proposals using tree format for clarity, showing:
- Proposed folder names
- Purpose of each folder
- Example of what would go in each folder
- Estimated number of files that would go in each folder based on current contents
