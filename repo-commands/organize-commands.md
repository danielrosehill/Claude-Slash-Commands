Analyze the slash commands in the commands/public and commands/private directories and suggest better organizational structure.

Your task:
1. Review the current folder structure and command placement
2. Identify commands that might be misplaced or could be better organized
3. Look for opportunities to create new subcategories or consolidate existing ones
4. Check for inconsistent naming patterns
5. Suggest a reorganization plan with specific move operations

Present your analysis including:
- Current structure observations
- Proposed changes (which files to move where)
- Rationale for each suggested change
- Any new folders that should be created

After presenting the plan, ask if I want you to execute the reorganization or if I want to modify the plan first.
